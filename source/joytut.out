1 - Numbers and Lists

One of the data types in Joy is the type of integers.
Literal integers are written in ordinary decimal notation.
The usual binary operators are:  +  -  *  /
But these operators are written after their arguments.
What will the program   2  3  +   leave on the stack ?
ÿ	hahaha 
An integer is expected:
	1234 
No, the right answer is:  5 
What will the program   7  6  *   leave on the stack ?
	42 
Excellent.
What will the program   7  6  *  2  3  +  -   leave on the stack ?
	36 
No, the right answer is:  37 
The most important aggregate datatype is that of lists.
These are written inside square brackets, like this:
        [42 17 3 9 35]
Some important operators for lists are:
    first      rest      cons      concat
What will the program   [5 4 2 7]  first   leave on the stack ?
	5 
Terrific.
What will the program   [5 4 2 7]  rest   leave on the stack ?
	7 
A list is expected:
	[2 4 7] 
No, the right answer is:  [4 2 7] 
What will the program   8  [9 3]  cons   leave on the stack ?
	[  8  9   3    ] 
Great.
What will the program   [5 3]  dup  concat   leave on the stack ?
	[ [5 3] 5 3] 
No, the right answer is:  [5 3 5 3] 
What will the program   [5 3]  dup  cons   leave on the stack ?
	[ [5 3] 5 3] 
Good.
What will the dots   ...   have to be, so that
	...  [3 2 4]  concat
leaves    [7 3 3 2 4]    on the stack ?
	[73] 
No, the right answer is:  [7 3] 
You answered 4 of the 9 questions correctly.

2 - The map and filter combinators

Combinators are similar to operators, they expect something
on the stack. But combinators always expect a quoted program
and perhaps something else. For example, the   map   combinator
expects a single program and below that an aggregate, e.g. a list.
What will the program   [3 2 4] [dup +] map   leave on the stack ?
	[ 9 4  16] 
No, the right answer is:  [6 4 8] 
What will the dots   ...   have to be, so that
	[3 2 4]  ...  map
leaves    [13 12 14]    on the stack ?
	[ 10 + ] 
Terrific.
Another example is the   filter   combinator, which expects
a program that computes a truth value, and below that an aggregate.
What will the program   
	[5 16 3 7 14]  [10 <]  filter   leave on the stack ?
	[5 3 7] 
Terrific.
For the next question, provide the shortest answer
What will the dots   ...   have to be, so that
	[5 10 9 11 2]  [10 +]  map   ...  filter
leaves    [15 19 12]    on the stack ?
	[ 20 <] 
Splendid.
You answered 3 of the 4 questions correctly.

3 - The ifte and linrec combinators

Two more complicated combinators are the  ifte  and the  linrec
combinators.  The  ifte  combinator expects three quotation parameters
on the stack. In most cases they have been pushed just beforehand.
What will the program   5  [7 <]  [10 +]  [10 -]  ifte   leave on the stack ?
	15 
Good.
What will the program   8  [7 <]  [10 +]  [10 -]  ifte   leave on the stack ?
	-8 
No, the right answer is:  -2 
A programmer wants to write a recursive definition of the
factorial function, which has the form:
    factorial ==
      ...                           (* first  quote *)
      ...                           (* second quote *)
      ...                           (* third  quote *)
      ifte
What could be used as the first quote?
	[ 0 =] 
Great.
What could be used as the second quote?
	[ succ ] 
Splendid.
This question is harder:
What could be used as the third quote?
	[ factorial *] 
No, the right answer must be one of the following:
	[dup pred factorial *]   [dup 1 - factorial *]   
Later the programmer realises that the factorial function
is only needed in one place of the program, so it would be good
not to have the definition at all, by using the  linrec  combinator:
      [ null ] 			(* first  quote *)
      [ succ ]                       (* second quote *)
      ...                            (* third  quote *)
      ...                            (* fourth quote *)
      linrec
What could be used as the third quote ?
	[  dup  pred  ] 
Terrific.
What could be used as the fourth quote ?
	[ * ] 
Excellent.
You answered 5 of the 7 questions correctly.


To repeat something, here are the sections again
  1 - Numbers and Lists
  2 - The map and filter combinators
  3 - The ifte and linrec combinators
Type the number of the section you want, or 
type  0  to do all sections, or
type any other number (even negative) to quit.

2 - The map and filter combinators

Combinators are similar to operators, they expect something
on the stacgc - 49 nodes inspected, 24 nodes copied, clock: 1
k. But combinators always expect a quoted program
and perhaps something else. For example, the   map   combinator
expects a single program and below that an aggregate, e.g. a list.
What will the program   [3 2 4] [dup +] map   leave on the stack ?
	[6 4 8] 
Good.
What will the dots   ...   have to be, so that
	[3 2 4]  ...  map
leaves    [13 12 14]    on the stack ?
	[ 10 +  ] 
Splendid.
Another example is the   filter   combinator, which expects
a program that computes a truth value, and below that an aggregate.
What will the program   
	[5 16 3 7 14]  [10 <]  filter   leave on the stack ?
	[5 3 7] 
Excellent.
For the next question, provide the shortest answer
What will the dots   ...   have to be, so that
	[5 10 9 11 2]  [10 +]  map   ...  filter
leaves    [15 19 12]    on the stack ?
	[ 20 <] 
Excellent.
